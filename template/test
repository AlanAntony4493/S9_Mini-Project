Implementing real-time notifications for a Django website can be quite extensive, and it involves multiple components and technologies. Here's a step-by-step example of how to implement real-time notifications for a career guidance forum where users receive notifications when a new question is posted. This example assumes you already have a Django project set up.

**Step 1: Install and Configure Django Channels**

1. Install Django Channels using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install channels
   ```

2. Update your project's settings to include Channels:

   ```python
   # settings.py

   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # ...
       'channels',
   ]

   CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
       "default": {
           "BACKEND": "channels.layers.InMemoryChannelLayer",
       },
   }

   ASGI_APPLICATION = "your_project.routing.application"
   ```

**Step 2: Create Routing Configuration**

Create a routing configuration for Django Channels to handle WebSocket connections.

Create a `routing.py` file in your project directory:

```python
# routing.py
from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter, URLRouter
from django.urls import path
from . import consumers

websocket_urlpatterns = [
    path("ws/notifications/", consumers.NotificationConsumer.as_asgi()),
]

application = ProtocolTypeRouter(
    {
        "websocket": AuthMiddlewareStack(
            URLRouter(websocket_urlpatterns)
        ),
    }
)
```

**Step 3: Create a WebSocket Consumer**

Create a WebSocket consumer that listens for notifications and sends them to connected clients.

Create a `consumers.py` file in your app directory:

```python
# consumers.py
import json
from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer

class NotificationConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        await self.accept()

    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        pass

    async def receive(self, text_data):
        # You can add logic here to handle different types of notifications
        message = json.loads(text_data)["message"]

        await self.send(text_data=json.dumps({
            "message": message
        }))
```

**Step 4: Create a View for Posting Questions**

Create a view for users to post questions to the career guidance forum. This view should trigger the notification when a new question is posted.

```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from django.contrib import messages
from .consumers import NotificationConsumer

def post_question(request):
    # Handle the form submission and save the question
    # Notify users about the new question
    question_text = request.POST.get("question_text")
    # Logic to save the question to the database

    # Notify connected WebSocket clients about the new question
    NotificationConsumer.notify_new_question(question_text)

    messages.success(request, "Your question has been posted successfully.")
    return redirect("forum")
```

**Step 5: Create JavaScript for WebSocket Connection**

In your HTML template, include JavaScript to establish a WebSocket connection and handle incoming notifications.

```html
<!-- template.html -->
<script>
    const socket = new WebSocket("ws://your_server/ws/notifications/");

    socket.onmessage = (event) => {
        const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
        // Handle the incoming notification
        console.log("New notification:", data.message);
        // You can display the notification in a user-friendly way
    };
</script>
```

**Step 6: Test the Notifications**

- Start your Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`

- Create a form for posting questions in your HTML templates.

- Submit a question through the form to trigger the notification. The notification should be displayed in real-time to all connected clients.

This example provides a basic structure for implementing real-time notifications in a Django forum when a new question is posted. You can extend this to handle different types of notifications and customize the notification display to suit your needs. Additionally, consider using a production-ready channel layer backend (instead of the in-memory layer used here) when deploying your project to production.
